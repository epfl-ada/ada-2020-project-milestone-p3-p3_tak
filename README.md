# Title: VIX

# Abstract

The original paper focuses on proving that search engine data (Google Trends more specifically) can help predict near term indicators by building simple baseline models with and without the search data. We propose as a first step to further investigate that claim by building better models, hopefully obtaining a stronger proof of the Google Trends data. Secondly we'd like to test this technique on something more "tangible". We propose to predict each months' Tesla vehicules sales. Automakers release their sales numbers

# Research Questions

- Can we improve the baseline models proposed in the paper ?
- Do Google Trends really improve the predictions or was it just due to a bad model ?
- Can we predict the VIX index ?
